* install phaser with CDN
* width and height propeties set the size of the canvas element
* the canvas element is the rendering context where all the drawings from the code will go into
* the preload funtion is a section of the code and it contains the images that i want to load in
* the create funtion is another section that contains code of creating the images i want to load in
* Game objects(the images) are positioned centered so make the x and y value the center of the canvas
* put the pngs from phaser into a folder so you can access them and actually load them
* to put the code from downloaded zip files, you gotta extract them first
